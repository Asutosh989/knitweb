knitting web app frontend and backend

knitting pattern editor

## Pattern Generator Usage:

1. Load a pattern using 'Browse'.
2. Then tick 'crop' if the pattern wants to be cropped and then click 'Draw'. 
3. Then select available yarn colours from the pallette.
4. Then Click 'Generate Patteren'.

## Offline Pattern Generation:

1. Go to /knitweb/offline_app directory.
2. run the run.sh file typing sh run.sh

## Drawing tools usage

There are two kinds of drawing tools included inside the pattern grid.

1. Square/Rectangular pattern drawing.
2. Free hand pattern drawing.

###1 Under Square/Rectangular pattern drawing user will be able to draw rectangular shapes and add colours to the shape using colour pallette. 

###2 Under Free hand pattern drawing user will be able to draw using free hand and add colour values to the shape drawn.

Note: These drawing tools are now used to edit the patterns that are loaded from a file.
This can be improved such that user can draw a pattern from scratch using these tools that 
can be used for knitting. 

TODO: these drawing tools functionality is not much smooth in the current version. Will enhance
the user experience of these tools soon.
